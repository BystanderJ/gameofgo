# The Game of Go
A Windows Store (UWP) implementation of the ancient Chinese game of Go.

The Game of Go is available on the Windows Store as a Windows 10 compatible Universal Windows Platform app.  The original versions ran the Fuego AI on Windows Azure, but as of version 1.3 (April 2016), the AI is compiled in as a Windows Runtime Component.

It is implemented with C# and C++ (AI code borrowed from the Fuego project) using Visual Studio 2015.  The code should compile with no dependencies.
